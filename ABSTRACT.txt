This project presents an interactive learning advisor agent based on large language models (LLMs).
The agent actively collects user background information through multi-turn dialogue and provides
structured learning strategies. The system is implemented using the OpenAI API and Streamlit,
demonstrating the potential of AIGC-based agents in educational applications.
